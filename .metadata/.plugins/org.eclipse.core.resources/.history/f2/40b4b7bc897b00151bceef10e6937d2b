/*
	Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, 
	find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

	Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
	
	
	if m == 1 or n == 1
		return the cumulative sum 
	else
		create a m * n matrix to store the sum from (0,0) to that point
		for all n, matrix[0][n] equals to the cumulative sum for the previous nodes
		for all m, matrix[m][0] equals to the cumulative sum for the previous nodes
		loop i from 1 to n - 1
			loop j from 1 to m - 1
				matrix[i][j] = min(original number + matrix[i-1][j], original number + matrix[i][j-1])
